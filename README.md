This is a 16x2 serial character display using the following HP/Avago/Broadcom LEDs:

HDSP-2107 HDSP-2112 HDSP-2110 HDSP-2111 HDSP-2113
          HDSP-2122           HDSP-2121 HDSP-2123 

Any character received on the serial port is shown on the LED display.
The display provides a very complete ASCII character set, including accented characters. 

Optionally, a PS/2 keyboard can be connected. Any key typed on the keyboard is sent to the serial port. 

To use the display, plug a FTDI TTL-232R-5V USB to serial cable into the serial port header and a 5V DC 2A power supply, center pin positive, into the barrel jack connector.  Carefully check connector polarity before plugging in.

The display consists of a pcb board and an arduino sketch.
